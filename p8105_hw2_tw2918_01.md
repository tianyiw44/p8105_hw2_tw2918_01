# Probelm 1

## 1. Clean the data in pols-month.csv.

### (1) Use `separate()` to break up the variable `mon` into integer variables `year`, `month`, and `day`

### (2) replace month number with month abbreviation

### (3) create a `president` variable taking values `gop` and `dem`, and remove `prez_dem` and `prez_gop`

### (4) remove `day` variable

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )
```

``` r
pols_month_df = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE)|>
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -month_abb, -day, -starts_with("prez"))
```

## 2. clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above

### (1) Use `separate()` to break up the variable `date` into integer variables `year`, `month`, and `day`

### (2) replace month number with month abbreviation and remove `day` varialbe

### (3) arrange according to year and month

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE) |>
  arrange(year, month)|>
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)])|>
  select(year, month,close)
```

## 3. tidy the unemployment data

``` r
unemp_df = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")|>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

## 4. Join the datasets by merging `snp` into `pols`, and merging `unemployment` into the result

# Probelm 2

## 1. Read and Clearn Mr. Trash Wheel Dataset

``` r
mr_trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel( "./202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N549"
    ) |>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(
    homes_powered_new = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel="mr_trash_wheel",
    year=as.numeric(year)
    ) |>
  select(trash_wheel, everything(), -homes_powered)
```

## 2. Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
pf_trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel( "./202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:M96"
    ) |>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(
    homes_powered_new = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel = "professor_trash_wheel") |>
  select(trash_wheel, everything(), -homes_powered)
```

## 3. Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for Gwynnda Trash Wheel

``` r
gwy_trashwheel_df=
  read_excel( "./202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:K108"
    ) |>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(
    homes_powered_new = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel = "gwynnda_trash_wheel") |>
  select(trash_wheel, everything(), -homes_powered)
```

## 4. Combine Datasets

First, changed the above code to state which trash wheel is which
Second, unify variable type. fixed the column type of year variable in
Mr. Trash Wheel Dataset. Third combine datasets using `full_join` sine
we want to keep all values in three datasets.

``` r
mr_pf_trashwheel_df = 
  full_join(mr_trashwheel_df, pf_trashwheel_df)

trashwheel_df = 
  full_join(mr_pf_trashwheel_df, gwy_trashwheel_df)
```

## 5. Write a paragraph about the data

The `trashwheel_df` dataset contains data from all three dataset,
Mr.Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda Trash Wheel. It
contains 747 observations of trash collected. The data contains 16
variables. The variables include `month` `year` and `date` of the
collected `dumspter`, weight of the `dumspter`, measured in tons
(`weight_ton`), volume of the `dumspter`, measured in cubic yards
(`volume_cubic_yards`) and the type of trash collected, such as
`plastic_bottle`, `polysyrene`, `ciagrette_butt`,
`glass_bottle`,`grocery_bags`, `chip_bags`, `sports_ball` and
`plastic_bags`.There are missing values because each trash wheel
collects different types of trash and the combination creates missing
values for the type of trash they don’t collect. The last variable
`homes_powered_new` is number of homes powered by the collected trash,
calculated using`weight_ton` times 500 kilowatts of electricity creates
per ton, then divided by 30 kilowatts needed per home.

For available data, the total weight of trash collected by Professor
Trash Wheel is 190.12. The total number of cigarette butts collected by
Gwynnda in July of 2021 is 1.63^{4}.

# Probelm 3

## 1. Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of baseline demographics

``` r
baseline_df = 
  read_csv("./data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(
    sex = ifelse(sex == 0, "female", "male"),
    apoe4 = ifelse(apoe4 == 0, "non_carrier", "carrier"),
    age_at_onset = replace(age_at_onset, age_at_onset == ".", NA),
  ) |>
  filter(is.na(age_at_onset)|age_at_onset>current_age)
```

## 2. Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of the dataset

- when using `read_csv` to import data, I used `skip=1` to skip the
  first row. The first row is descriptions of the variables
- used `janitor::clean_names` to tidy variable names
- used the
  `mutat`e`function to replace`sex`value from`0`,`1`to`female`and`male\`
- used the `mutate` function to replace `apoe4` value from `0`,`1` to
  `non_carrier` and `carrier`
- used `mutate` function to replace missing value of `age_at_onset` from
  `.` to `NA`
- used `filter` function to select and exact only the rows that meet the
  stated inclusion criteria, no MCI at baseline, which is either a
  missing value of `age_at_onset` or when `age_at_onset` is larger than
  `current_age` at baseline
- There were 479 participants recruited
- Of those recruited, 93 developed MCI
- The average baseline age is 65.0286013
- 30% of women in the study are APOE4 carriers

## 3. Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of longitudinally observed biomarker values

``` r
long_biomaker_df = 
  read_csv("./data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip=1) |>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(baseline = replace(baseline, baseline == "Na", NA))|>
  rename(id = study_id)
```

## 4. Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of the dataset

- when using `read_csv` to import data, I used `skip=1` to skip the
  first row. The first row is descriptions of the variables.
- used `janitor::clean_names` to tidy variable names
- used `mutate` to replace `basline` value “Na” to `NA`
- used `rename` function to rename study_id to id to make it consistant
  with `baseline_df`
- There were 487 participants in this dataset
- The average `baseline` time in years when biomaker amyloid is measured
  is NA
- The average 2nd time in year when biomaker amyloid is measured is NA,
  4th time is NA, 6th time is NA and 8th time is NA
